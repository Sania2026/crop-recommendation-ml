# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learningâ€“based web application that predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on input parameters like soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

I explored this project to deepen my understanding of Flask-based web app development and integrating machine learning models in real-world use cases.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Crop Prediction** using trained machine learning models  
- **User-friendly web interface** built with Flask and HTML  
- **Data preprocessing** using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler  
- Multiple `.pkl` model files integrated into the app backend  
- Hosted locally using `Flask` for testing and iteration

## ðŸ’» How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sania2026/crop-recommendation-ml.git
cd crop-recommendation-ml

# (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn

# Run the app
python app.py


# Key Features
Input Data Collection: The system allows users to input relevant data such as soil parameters, climate information, and geographic location.
Data Preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables.
Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models.
Model Training and Evaluation: The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Crop Recommendation: Based on the trained models, the system recommends the most suitable crops for the given input parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily input their data, view recommendations, and explore additional information.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing the web interface.
JavaScript: Scripting language used for client-side interactions and enhancing the user interface.
# Installation and Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation-system.git
